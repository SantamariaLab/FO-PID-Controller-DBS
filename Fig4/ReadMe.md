FO-PID-Controller-DBS

#These programs generate the Figure 4 presented in the paper titled:

#Fractional order controllers increase the robustness of closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems

#Authors: Antonio Coronel, J. Francisco-Gomez Aguilar, Ivanka Stamova and Fidel Santamaria

#We include the sufficient and necessary code and data to create the Figures 4, we suggest to use a fast processing computer.

#The file Stable.mat and Oscillatory.mat are the data to generate the Figure 4.

#If you only want to generate the Figure, run the files here, if you want to generate the data use the code in Figure 2 with the proper values

#All codes were created by Antonio Coronel and Fidel Santamaria
