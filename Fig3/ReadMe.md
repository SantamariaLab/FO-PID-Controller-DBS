FO-PID-Controller-DBS

#These programs generate all the Figure 3 presented in the paper titled:

#Fractional order controllers increase the robustness of closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems

#Authors: Antonio Coronel, J. Francisco-Gomez Aguilar, Ivanka Stamova and Fidel Santamaria

#The project was developed at the University of Texas at San Antonio under supervision of Dr. Fidel Santamaria

#We include the sufficient and necessary code and data to create the Figures 3, we suggest to use a fast processing computer

#The funtion FControl_STN.m is the numerical solution of the mathematical model used here, we suggest to include it in the main path.

#If you only want to generate the Figure 3, run code GenerateFig3.m, if you want to generate the data, run the code Max_gain_analysis.m

#All codes were created by Antonio Coronel and Fidel Santamaria
